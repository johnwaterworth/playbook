# Setting up a new project 

At dxw we frequently start new projects and work with clients we haven’t worked with before. 

Delivery managers at dxw are responsible for setting up projects and ensuring all the right things are in place for when the team starts work. 

We often find that time is limited and transitioning between projects can be a challenge, for not only delivery managers but also the wider team.

This guide provides advice and tips, as well as a checklist for delivery managers about to start a new project. It can work for large projects (a phase of work like a discovery or beta) as well as smaller projects which might only be a sprint or two.

## Before a project starts

In most cases, there’s not a very long lead time between winning a piece of work and starting it. We sometimes have a number of days, rather than weeks, for the team to get everything in place. This includes things like contracts, scheduling a team to do the work and making a plan for the first few days. 

We’re lucky if the same delivery manager has been involved in the sales work that led to the project being won, because there’s always other work in flight. It’s important that knowledge is shared and the necessary introductions made so we can get the work off to a good start.

It is however worth remembering that most of our sales proposals are produced with limited information about the project, and it’s only once we start that we get a better idea of what the work is and what skills we’ll need to do it. 

There are several things that delivery managers should do first, regardless of the shape of the project:

### Do some reading 

Get hold of any background materials, such as proposal documents, meeting notes, project documents or email chains. Familiarise yourself with the brief and conversations that have taken place so far

### Speak to the person who has had the most involvement in the work to date 

Find out who led the sales bid, or who has the most knowledge about the project at dxw. This should give you a fairly good understanding of what the project is, what work has been done so far and what dxw is expected to deliver. Find out who’s who in the client organisation, and ask for an introduction to the main point of contact there.

### Meet the client team 

At the earliest opportunity, arrange a meeting with the client. It might be one person at this stage or everyone that will be involved in the project. Use the time to build rapport and get to know each other, as well as agree a start date and schedule any important meetings that need to be held in the first few weeks. If you can, bring along other team members as it might be useful to have their input.

### Ask lots of questions

Whether you’re talking to the person who led the sales bid, or the client team, ask questions. 

- What is the brief? What outputs or outcomes are we expected to deliver?
- Who is the service manager or product owner in the client team? 
- Who are the important stakeholders we need to be aware of?
- Who from the client team will be working full-time on the project? 
- Are there any deadlines, dependencies or risks that the team need to be aware of?
- What skills and capabilities do the client team have? Are they used to working in agile teams? Have they delivered a digital service before? Are they familiar with user research?

## Setting up the project

Before the project starts there’s also a number of tasks, mostly administrative ones, that need to be done. Below is a checklist of things that need to be in place for a typical project.

- Send out calendar invitations for regular ceremonies:
  - Standups - daily, 10-15 minutes between 10:00-11:00 (ideally after the dxw company standup)
  - Sprint planning meetings - fortnightly, for anything between 1-3 hours, usually on the first day of a sprint (a Wednesday)
  - Retrospectives - fortnightly, usually held at the end of a sprint or before planning
  - Show and tells - fortnightly, at the end of a sprint for most projects. The client can help you identify a suitable time and place (we recommend keeping it to a regular time to maximise attendance) 
- Create a Slack channel and add dxw and client team members. Clients and contractors should be set up as single-channel guests
- Create a Trello board for the project. Use the standard dxw columns or make up your own, depending on the needs of the project and how the team want to work
- Create a Google Drive folder, under ‘Client work’ for the project. Use this to store any documents, files, week notes and anything else that the team might need access to. Make sure everyone in the team knows where to find it, and give clients and contractors access to individual documents or sub-folders as required
- Set up a video-call for standups so that anyone working remotely or from another location can join. We like to use appear.in and talky.io 
- Create a week notes document, using the template
- Organise a kick-off meeting with the client, either a few days before the first sprint or on the first day. The whole team should attend this
- Check that commercial tasks have been done. It’s worth checking there’s a signed order summary (this should be shared with you ahead of time) and this matches the schedule in 10,000ft.  Check invoices have been created in Xero and you know where to find them. Also check 10,000ft early so you’re aware of any upcoming holiday being taken by the team
- Create a spreadsheet to track days worked against the order summary. This will show you how money is being spent against the forecasted budget, and help you in any conversations with the client about team changes, extending the project or issues with budget.

## Kick off meeting

While the project is being set up, and before it starts, a kick off meeting should happen. The purpose of this is to introduce the team to each other, discuss and agree how the team want to work, and to create a plan for the first few days of the project. 

You should have everyone working on the project in this meeting (even if they’re part-time). 

The meeting can be structured in any way you want, but there’s a number of different outcomes you should look to get out of it.

### Introductions

Use the kick-off to introduce everyone to each other. It shouldn’t just be about people’s names, but roles and what each person will be doing on the project. Highlight people’s experience and expertise, particularly if it’s going to benefit the project or subject matter you’re working on.

### Talk about dxw ways of working

Give an overview of how dxw works. Don’t assume that everyone in the client team has read the original proposal or visited the dxw website. Explain how we work - agile mindset, culture, our approach to delivery, sprint ceremonies, writing stories, story workflow, the code review process, dxw Fridays

### Discuss how the team want to work 

Clients will have their own way of working on projects and if they’ve used agile approaches before, it’s probably a different flavour of agile to what the team are used to. Ask the client team to talk about how they’re used to working on projects and agree some principles for how the single team will work together. 

There’s always something to discuss here.  For example, how will week notes be written and who should they be sent to? Who needs to be invited to show and tells? How will user stories be written? Is there a story template the team want to use, and will developers estimate them?

### Talk about co-location 

If you’re going to be co-located with the client, ask to visit the office space and have a look around. Go through the co-lo checklist and buy any equipment or things the team will need. It’s also worth in this meeting to agree which days will be spent co-lo and which at dxw. 

When the team are going to be in different locations, think about technology and how to make sure each team member is able to join meetings and work with others. It might be useful to buy some extra microphones, good headphones or additional screens for the team.
